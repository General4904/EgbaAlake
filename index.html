<h2>Monuments & Artefacts</h2>

<article id= "Yoruba"><u> The Yoruba Culture </u></article>

<article> <figure><img src="images/ori_olokun.jpg" id= "olokun"><figcaption>Ori Olokun</figcaption></figure> The history of the 
  Yoruba people begins in Ile-Ife(Ife Empire). This kingdom was founded by the deity Oduduwa, who is believed to 
  have created the world. Oduduwa was the first divine king of the Yoruba people. It is said the Yoruba people
  believe that their civilization began at Ile-Ife where the gods descended to earth.

The Ethnic group became popular internationally due to their trading with the Portuguese which gave them guns for 
their trade. The Yoruba were invaded by the Fulani in the early 1800s, which pushed the people to the South. In the
late 1800s, they formed a treaty with the British Empire and were colonized by Britain beginning in 1901.

The people who lived in Yorubaland, at least by the seventh century BC, were not initially known as the Yoruba, 
although they shared a common ethnicity and language group. The historical Yoruba develop in situ, out of earlier 
(Mesolithic)Volta-Niger populations, by the 1st millennium BC.

Archaeologically, the settlement at Ile-Ife can be dated to the 4th century BC, with urban structures appearing in 
the 8th-10th Centuries. "Between 700 and 900 A.D., the city began to develop as a major artistic center," And "by 
the 12thCentury Ife artists were creating bronze, stone, and terracotta sculptures." The phase of Ile-Ife before 
the rise of Oyo, 1100 - 1600, is sometimes described as a "golden age" of Ile-Ife.
